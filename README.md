# Average x 

## Problem Description
Write a function that takes input numbers and returns their average. Use the starter code to help you with format. 

## Example
```
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2

3
```

## Suggested Approach
1) In the main part of the code, collect the numbers to be averaged in a list. I recommend using a loop to do this.
2) The function should return the average (called `average`).
3) The inputs should be gathered in 'main' and used as arguments in the function call.
4) Test your code when you think it works (pytest).

## Hints
* Decide how you want to collect the numbers. Do you want to ask how many numbers the user is going to average and use that to define your loop or do you want to collect numbers until the user types something to exit the loop?
* The function `len()` returns the length of a list or string
* The function `sum()` returns the sum of the elements in a list (assuming the elements are numbers, of course!)
